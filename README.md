# ADO Tiers Layered App

Welcome to the ADO Tiers Layered App repository! This repository showcases an implementation of ADO.NET in a layered architecture, providing a structured approach for developing applications with separate layers for data access, business logic, and user interface. The goal is to demonstrate the benefits of using a layered or tiered architecture compared to spaghetti code.

## Overview

In this project, we have organized our application into the following layers:

1. **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: This layer is responsible for all database-related operations. It contains DBManagers that communicate with the database using ADO.NET APIs and Stored Procedures in SQL Server. The DAL abstracts the details of data access and provides a clean interface for the upper layers.

2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**: The BLL layer contains entities and entity managers. Entities represent the classes that are mapped from the database tables. EntitiesList is a collection of entities, while EntityManagers act as the link between the DAL and the BLL. The BLL layer encapsulates the business logic and serves as an intermediary between the data access layer and the user interface.

3. **User Interface (UI) Layer**: The UI layer represents the final presentation layer of the application. In this case, it is a Windows Forms application. However, the principles of the layered architecture can be applied to other types of user interfaces such as web apps, mobile apps, and more. The UI layer interacts with the BLL to perform operations on the entities and display the results to the user.

## The Importance of Layered Architecture

The use of a layered or tiered architecture brings several advantages over spaghetti code, where all the code is tightly coupled and lacks proper separation of concerns. Here are some key benefits of using a layered architecture:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility and is independent of the others. This separation allows for better code organization, easier maintenance, and improved testability.

2. **Modularity**: With a layered architecture, it is easier to introduce changes or add new features without impacting other parts of the application. The layers can be developed and tested independently, promoting code reusability and scalability.

3. **Code Reusability**: The clear separation of concerns enables the reuse of code across different projects and platforms. For example, the DAL and BLL layers can be reused in other applications that require data access and business logic functionality.

4. **Scalability**: Layered architectures provide a scalable foundation for applications. As the complexity and size of the project grow, the layers can be extended or modified without affecting the entire application. This scalability allows for better team collaboration and efficient development processes.

5. **Maintainability**: The layered approach simplifies maintenance and troubleshooting. If an issue arises, it is easier to pinpoint the layer where the problem originates and address it without impacting other parts of the application.
